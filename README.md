Term-RW
=========================

Term-RW will be an extension of the Prolog programming supporting term
rewriting. Term-RW will be implemented as a meta-interpreter for SWI-Prolog.

Currently, the system exposes a library defining the rules to simplify algebraic
expressions, and a predicate `simplify(+Term, -Normal)` that finds the normal
form of a term.
